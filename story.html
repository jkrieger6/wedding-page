        <h2>Sarah and Jake's story</h2>
        <p>Our story begins in May of 2020. We met working together at Starbucks and immediately hit it off as friends. We spent the next year hanging out getting to know each other and adopting eachothers dogs. In April of 2021, we decided it was time to date.</p>
        <p>On our first date, we went to a local sunset spot with Tollie and enjoyed a picnic and the ocean views. We had a great time and immediately were inseperable from that day forward.We knew we had something special. After a few months of dating, we decided to move in together. We've been living together ever since.</p>
        <p>Together we love to travel anywhere we can go. We have traveled around the states exploring as many places as we can see. Sarah and myself have taken trips to Mexico, Indonesia, Portugal and Spain
            and we have many more trips planned for the future.
        </p>
        <p>In the winter of 2022, we got engaged. Now this October 2024, we are getting married. We're so excited to start this new chapter of our lives 
            together and can't wait to celebrate with you!</p></p>
